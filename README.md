# Intern project


- The project work focus on metabolomics, specifically on purine metabolites and how they respond to different concentrations of added sugars in transformed cells. 


### METABOLOMICS: A study of small molecules that are produced as the product of metabolism. 

- I have been working on this project work using Python and R. To analyse and report the analysis, I use Jupyter Notebook, along with Pandas, R-studio (ggplots), Random Forest. 

- The Original file is in EXCEL format and is subsetted into two files based on TIME variable. Later, from which Fold change values are calculated and stored as two separate files. Uding modified and orginial files, in R performed various statistical test to produce resultant output. The R code output is shown below each code for explicit understanding using Juypter Notebook. 

- All the orginial and modified files are uploaded in the Github.
