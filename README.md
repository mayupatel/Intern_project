# Intern project on Metabolomics


### What is Metabolomics??
- Metabolomics is the large-scale study of small molecules, commonly known as metabolites, within cells, biofluids, tissues or organisms. Metabolomics best represents the molecular phenotype.

### Metabolome:
- It refers to the complete set of small-molecule metabolites (such as metabolic intermediates, hormones and other signaling molecules,and secondary metabolites) to be found within a biological sample, such as a single organism.

### Project Work:

- The project work focus on metabolomics, specifically on purine metabolites and how they respond to different concentrations of added sugars in transformed cells. 

- Languages used: Python and R

- To analyse and report the analysis, I use Jupyter Notebook for both Python and R code, along with Pandas,ggplots, and Random Forest. 

- Using Python the raw 'cellC_met.xlsx' data file is parsed and cleaned to remove the duplicate values by calculating the mean values of that data and stored in metabolite_data.xlsx file. The final file is subset into two files based on TIME variable.
